# ARM-verilog-project
Reverse Engineered 32-bit ARM processor with 8-bit data bus and decoding multiple ISAs

The first objective of this project is to design, simulate, and implement a multicycle 32-bit microprocessor and 8-bit data bus with ARM architecture which supports the following instructions:
•	Data processing
•	Single data transfer
•	Branch 

The second objective of the project is to decode multiple ISAs in single platform which are ARM and RISC-V architectures
